# CoderSchool FTW -  Number Guessing Game

Created with love by: Loi Tran

A game built using HTML, CSS, and JS. The game asks the user to guess a number between 1-100. The user has 5 guesses to guess correctly!

## Try it out

Demo online at [this link.](https://festive-thompson-5eeb3f.netlify.com/)

## Video Walkthrough

## State

The following is an object which represents our application's `state`. Understanding how to work with this object is critical to how the application behaves.

## User Stories

The following **functionalities** are completed:

* [x] User is prompted to play the game
* [x] User starts game with 5 guesses
* [x] User can guess a number using an input.
* [x] When the user guesses the input is cleared.
* [x] User's guesses are limited to 5
* [x] User's guess is compared to a randomly generated value between 1-100
* [x] If the user guess is higher than the randomly generated value, the user is prompted accordingly
* [x] If the user guess is lower than the randomly generated value, the user is prompted accordingly
* [x] User can reset the game if they run out of guesses
* [x] If user guesses correctly, the game is automatically reset
* [x] Colors are used to help the user understand the state of their game.

## Time Spent and Lessons Learned

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total.

I learned how to implement a 'react-like' structure for the application using JS. After a few refactors the code ended up a lot cleaner. I also learned how forms work in bootstrap better. If properly setup they can fire actions on enter press without an event listener.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
